<p>This website was created by Chase DeVitto and is intended for the user to select how many characters long they would like their password to be from the available options.
   There are also options for whether or not the user would like to incorporate uppercase letters, numbers and special chracters in the password.
   The program will then spit out a brand new fully randomized password for the user.</p>
